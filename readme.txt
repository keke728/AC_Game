Code NinjaIntroduction: In this game, we adapted the classic game Fruit Ninja to be an accessible Code Ninja game using Phaser.js, which could be played with the eye tracker.Instruction: You can run this game on any device by visiting: https://keke728.github.io/Input/Project2/, or by using the zip file and running it on a local server.Most of the game functionality was inspired from the codpen code below. We did learn a lot about the phaser framework and added multiple levels, along with a sprites for different code icons. Loading a texture onto a sprite took a very long time to figure out.GitHub Repo Code Link: https://github.com/keke728/AC_Game/References:https://github.com/legacy-icons/vendor-iconshttp://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/30010-euhm-scaling-a-weaponbullets/https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples/blob/master/examples/particles/particle%20scale.jshttps://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/Phaser.Group.html#createMultiplehttps://codepen.io/labdev/pen/sCAKe
